# 🥚 Egg Timer

## 📖 Project Overview

**Egg Timer** is a fun and interactive mini frontend project where users can start a timer to cook eggs in three different styles — soft, medium, or hard boiled.  
While the timer runs, users can enjoy reading quirky “Did You Know?” chicken facts.  
This was built as a practice project to strengthen **DOM manipulation, event handling, transitions, and animations**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – styling, transitions, and animations
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – DOM manipulation, event handling, timer logic, audio playback
- **Figma** – initial design and layout planning

## 👨‍💻 Role

This project was created solely by me as a **frontend practice project**.  
The goal was to explore core web development concepts while building something simple yet playful.

  - Soft-boiled egg (3 minutes)
